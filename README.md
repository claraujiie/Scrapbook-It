Scrapbook It generates a prototype simulating a flip-through scrapbook. You can use the [Scrapbook Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1037975581461148707/Scrapbook-Template) provided, or you can create your own pages. Once your pages are set up with your own images and captions, run the plugin. It will create a new page within your Figma document, which you can then play as a flip-thru scrapbook by clicking the "Preview" icon.

Share your prototype link with family and friends!
